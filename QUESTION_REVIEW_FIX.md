# Question Review Fix - Show User's Selected Answer

## ‚úÖ **Problem Identified**

The Question Review component was not showing what the user actually selected during the test. It was only showing the correct answer.

## üîß **Root Cause**

1. **Data Format Mismatch**: The test was storing option IDs (UUIDs) but the review component expected option indices (numbers)
2. **Incorrect Selection Logic**: The component was using `parseInt(option.id)` which doesn't work with UUIDs

## üöÄ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Fixed Test Component (`src/app/test/[testId]/run/page.tsx`)**
- **Changed**: Store option indices instead of option IDs
- **Before**: `[currentQuestion.id]: [option.id]` (UUID)
- **After**: `[currentQuestion.id]: [index]` (number)

### **2. Fixed Question Review Component (`src/components/QuestionReview.tsx`)**
- **Changed**: Use option indices to check selections
- **Before**: `userAnswers.includes(parseInt(option.id))`
- **After**: `userAnswers.includes(optionIndex)`

### **3. Enhanced Visual Indicators**
- **Correct Answer**: Green background with checkmark + "Correct Answer" label
- **User's Wrong Answer**: Red background with X + "Your Answer" label  
- **User's Correct Answer**: Green background with checkmark + "Your Answer ‚úì" label
- **Unselected Options**: Gray background with empty circle

## üéØ **Result**

Now the Question Review shows:

### **For Each Option:**
- ‚úÖ **Correct Answer**: Green highlight + "Correct Answer" label
- ‚úÖ **User's Selection**: Red highlight + "Your Answer" label (if wrong)
- ‚úÖ **User's Correct Selection**: Green highlight + "Your Answer ‚úì" label
- ‚úÖ **Unselected Options**: Gray highlight

### **Visual Indicators:**
- üü¢ **Green**: Correct answer
- üî¥ **Red**: User's wrong answer
- ‚ö™ **Gray**: Unselected options
- ‚úÖ **Checkmark**: Correct answer
- ‚ùå **X**: User's wrong answer

## üîç **Debug Information**

Added console logging to help troubleshoot:
```javascript
console.log('QuestionReview Debug:', {
  currentQuestionId: currentQuestion?.id,
  userAnswers,
  resultDataAnswers: resultData?.answers,
  isCorrect
})
```

## ‚ú® **User Experience**

Now when students review their test results:
1. **Clear Visual Feedback**: Easy to see what they selected vs. correct answer
2. **Color-Coded Options**: Green for correct, red for wrong selections
3. **Clear Labels**: "Correct Answer" and "Your Answer" labels
4. **Complete Picture**: Shows both correct answer and user's choice

The Question Review now provides complete transparency about both the correct answers and what the user actually selected during the test!
